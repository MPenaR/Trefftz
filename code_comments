a point x in R^n is _never_ in a subset with 0 n-Lebesgue measure. Hence get_ID only returns triangles.

A mesh has two types of structures and philosophies:
- For mesh creation and manipulation we use pythonic datacontainers and methods ( collections, lists comprehensions, dictionaries...). 
They are not vectorized but they are only called a couple of times
- Mesh only exports numpy structured arrays for fast manipulation by the DG-Trefftz assembler. These are vectorized, the assembler knows nothing about the mesh internals.

Mesh internals: 
- an edge IS a couple of nodes, they could be a frozenset, they could be hashable.

A mesh should export two different sets of edges: inner edges and outer edges
The former belong to two triangles while the last only to one. Furthermore the this two subset of edges should be further separated by boundary conditions (by boundary definition)
